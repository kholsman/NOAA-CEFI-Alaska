# ** A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. Eg. ‚Äù**/foo/bar" 
# 		matches file or directory "bar" anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".
# A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. 
# An asterisk "*" matches anything except a slash.
# A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches 
# 		zero or more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and so on.
# An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded 
# 		by a previous pattern will become included again.
